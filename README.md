# Java Collection

A collection represents a group of objects, known as its elements. Some collections allow duplicate elements and others
do not. Some are ordered and others unordered. The JDK does not provide any direct implementations of this interface: it
provides implementations of more specific subinterfaces like Set and List. This interface is typically used to pass
collections around and manipulate them where maximum generality is desired.
